        Cristiano Ronaldo began his professional career at Sporting CP in Portugal, where his speed and ball control soon made him the center of attention. The turning point in his career was in 2003, when Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, after seeing a friendly match, signed him, showcasing the dribbler’s and the artist’s qualities together. The player’s metamorphosis from a young winger to a complete forward was one of the great successes of the club, and scoring even the first Ballon d'Or for him in the year 2008 was one of the steps on the way.

        In 2009, the transfer of CR7 from Manchester United to Real Madrid was the most expensive to date (£80 million), and it marked the best period of his career. He scored 450 times in 438 matches, becoming the first-ever scorer in the history of Real Madrid across 9 seasons. Among other things, Ronaldo's contributions included winning four Champions League titles for the club, two La Liga trophies, and numerous personal awards, all of which convinced everyone of his greatness. Their rivalry with Lionel Messi characterized this time in football history.

        After a splendid spell at Madrid, Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018, where he remained at the top of his game and won several Serie A titles. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, adding more goals to his already record-breaking career and making it the second time he had played for the team. He is playing for Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia at the moment, and his age of 39 has not affected his commitment to the sport one bit. His tireless energy, top-class professionalism, and passion still draw millions of fans worldwide who look up to him as an inspiration.
